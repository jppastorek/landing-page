This is a project at the end of CSS in The Odin Project.


30-Dec 6:18pm - I have been working on the Hero section, and  I am having trouble getting everything lined up properly. When I look at the images, the image and the items on the left are perfectly aligned.

I was struggling to figure how to group items. I went with two divs: one for the items on the left and one for the image placeholder. I just can't figure out how to get the right size of the image placeholder, and I can't get the things to line up on the bottom. This is the last piece until I move on to the Information section.



30-Dec 9:02pm - I forgot about the Hero section and moved on to the Information section. No problems. My only thought is that I have used lots of divs and really no other html tags. Is this a best practice? I mean, I got the job done so far.
